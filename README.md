# FactChecking

The aim of this project was binary classification based on tabular data, including text data. The dataset was a subset (ca. 1200 entries in the training set) of the benchmark liar dataset for fake news detection (https://aclanthology.org/P17-2067/). While the original dataset has six labels, here we were only interested in distinguishing the biggest lies (label: pants-fire) from all other statements. The features consisted mainly of text data such as the investigated statements, its context and subject. They also icluded some shorter text features such as the name and job of the speaker, and their political party affiliation.

I preprocessed the loger text columns with a custom stemming vectorizer, one hot encoding the rest and performed compared three models: Random Forest Classifier, Xgboost and a Bayes Classifier, together with three dimensionality reduction techniques: Truncated SVD, NMF and LDA. The best AUC on the validation set was obtained for the Random Forest Classifier with truncated SVD at 0.89. (This was a university project, where the test set was used for grading, so it was not distributed).
